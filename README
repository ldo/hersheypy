The [Hershey fonts](http://www.whence.com/hershey-fonts/) are a set of
fonts created by a Doctor A V Hershey in the 1960s. They are stroke
fonts, defined in terms of drawing lines, rather than filling in curve
outlines as with most scalable font formats. Thus, they cannot easily
be represented in a common font format like TrueType or Type 1.

I created this HersheyPy project as a testbed for the user-fonts
functionality in Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/qahirah)), my Python 3 wrapper for the
[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) graphics library, and these
scripts require you to have Qahirah installed. The enclosed
“`hershey_font.py`” module provides the basic functionality of loading
a Hershey font and creating a `UserFontFace` object from it that can
be used to draw text into a `Context`, while the remaining scripts are
examples that make use of this module:

* “`chart`” generates a chart of all the characters defined by a Hershey font
* “`render_text`” renders a line of text in a Hershey font
* “`pstype3`” converts a Hershey font to PostScript Type 3 format

Further examples of HersheyPy in action are available in the HersheyPy
Examples ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/hersheypy_examples),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/hersheypy_examples)) repository.

There is some additional debug functionality in the code that was put
in to do a more thorough exercising of Qahirah, but which is not
needed for “production” use and so has been disabled. Feel free to
nosey around...

Note that I do not include the Hershey fonts themselves: you can
download them from the link above. Or on a Debian 8.0 or later system,
the Hershey fonts come from the `hershey-fonts-data` package, and can be
found in the `/usr/share/hershey-fonts` directory when that package is
installed.
